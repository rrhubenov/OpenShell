//! Cross-component anonymous network activity event type.
//!
//! `ActivityEvent` is emitted by the supervisor's networking proxy and by
//! the supervisor's bypass monitor on every observed connection attempt
//! (allowed or denied). It is consumed by the orchestrator-side
//! `ActivityAggregator` which counts events, sanitizes deny groups, and
//! periodically flushes anonymous summaries to the gateway.
//!
//! It lives in `openshell-core` because both supervisor leaves
//! (`openshell-supervisor-network` and `openshell-supervisor-process`)
//! produce it and need a shared type without depending on each other.
